                          * SUPER EMPTY BALL *


Tilt the  floor to roll a  ball through an obstacle  course within the
given  time.  If  the ball  falls  or time  expires, a  ball is  lost.
Collect 100 coins to earn an extra ball.  Red coins are worth 5.  Blue
coins are worth 10.

Super Empty Ball requires:

    SDL               http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
    SDL_image         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
    SDL_mixer         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

To build:

    make                     (Unix)
or
    nmake /fMakefile-W32     (Windows with MSVC)

The executables will  be copied to the base  SEB directory.  Maps will
be processed and copied into  data/sol/.  The program must be run from
within the base  SEB directory in order for  materials and textures to
resolve correctly.

To run:

    ./ball

Click Play  to begin.  The floor  tilts in the direction  of the mouse
pointer.  The left and right  mouse buttons rotate the view point left
and right about the ball.

Spacebar pauses and resumes.  Escape  returns to the title screen, and
escape at the title screen exits.  F10 takes a screenshot.


(Any resemblance to any other software, game, or simulation related to
super forms of balls possibly non-empty potentially containing monkeys
is purely coincidental.)
