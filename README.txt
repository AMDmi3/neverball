                      * SUPER EMPTY BALL *

Super Empty Ball is an simulation of the physics of spheres  interacting
with  faceted solid geometry.  It has been tested only under  Linux  and
OSX. It requires libjpeg.

To build:

    make install

The executables will be copied into bin/. Environments will be processed
and copied into data/sol/. All programs must be run from within the base
seb directory in order for materials and textures to resolve correctly.

To run, specify a .sol file as a command line parameter to ball.

    bin/ball data/sol/move.sol
    bin/ball data/sol/flat.sol

The world tilts in the direction of the mouse curser.  Spacebar  redrops
the ball back at the origin.  Escape exits.

Any resemblance to any other software,  game,  or simulation related  to
super  forms of balls possibly non-empty potentially containing  monkeys
is purely coincidental.
