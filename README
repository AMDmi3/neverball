Super  Empty  Ball  is  an   simulation  of  the  physics  of  spheres
interacting with faceted solid geometry.  It requires:

    SDL               http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
    SDL_image         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
    SDL_mixer         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

To build:

    make                     (Unix)
or
    nmake /fMakefile-W32     (Windows with MSVC)

The executables will  be copied to the base  SEB directory.  Maps will
be processed and copied into  data/sol/.  The program must be run from
within the base  SEB directory in order for  materials and textures to
resolve correctly.

To run:

    ./ball

Click  to  begin.  The  world  tilts in  the  direction  of the  mouse
pointer.  Escape pauses  and resumes.  F1 while paused  returns to the
title screen, and F1 at the title screen exits.

The  physics system starts  to destablize  at about  50Hz, so  if your
system cannot  maintain 50  FPS then simulation  time will  run slower
than realtime.  If your video card  is lacking in power you can shrink
the window by modifying the constants at the top of src/main.c.


Any resemblance to any other  software, game, or simulation related to
super forms of balls possibly non-empty potentially containing monkeys
is purely coincidental.
