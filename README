                             * Neverball *


Tilt the  floor to roll a  ball through an obstacle  course within the
given time.  If the ball falls or time expires, a ball is lost.

Collect 100 coins  to save your progress and earn  an extra ball.  Red
coins are worth 5.  Blue coins are worth 10.


Neverball requires:

    SDL               http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
    SDL_image         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
    SDL_mixer         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
    SDL_ttf           http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/



* BUILDING

    make                     (Unix)
or
    nmake /fMakefile-W32     (Windows with MSVC)

The executables  will be copied to  the base directory.   Maps will be
processed and copied into data/sol/.  By default, an uninstalled build
may be executed in place.



* RUNNING

    ./neverball

Click Play  to begin.  The floor  tilts in the direction  of the mouse
pointer.

Spacebar pauses  and resumes.  Escape ends  a game, and  escape at the
title  screen  exits.   F9  toggles  a frame  counter.   F10  takes  a
screenshot.

Pause releases the pointer grab.   I get email about that so I'm gonna
yell it really loudly here so that I can say "RTFM" from now on.


              PRESS SPACEBAR TO RELEASE THE POINTER GRAB



* INSTALLATION

The game executable may be moved as desired.

However, game  assets are described  using relative path  names.  Thus
the game must  run within the data directory in  order for asset names
to resolve correctly.  Upon starting,  the game will attempt to change
into this directory, as defined in config.h.

If the data directory is to  be renamed or moved for installation, the
CONFIG_PATH variable in config.h must be changed to match.

Alternatively, the CONFIG_PATH variable may  be set to "." if the game
is started  from within the data directory.   Even MORE alternatively,
the data path may be specified as the first command line option.



* CONFIGURATION

Global settings  are stored  in the file  .neverballrc.  This  file is
created  when  the  game exits,  and  should  be  found in  your  home
directory.  It  consists of key /  value pairs.  Some  of these values
are configurable  using the in-game options  screen.  Other meaningful
keys and their default values follow.

    mouse_sense 300

        This  key controls  mouse  sensitivity.  The  value gives  the
        number of screen pixels the  mouse pointer must move to rotate
        the floor  through its entire  range.  A smaller  number means
        more sensitive.

    camera 0

        This   key   selects   from   3  different   camera   tracking
        modes. Throughout development,  a few different camera control
        strategies were tried.  Each  had its propents, but none could
        claim a majority.

        0 - Strict  camera stays behind the ball by  cueing off of the
        motion of the ball.  Very responsive but sometimes confusing.

        1 - Lazy  camera chases a point a set  distance from the ball.
        Seldom surprising but sometimes insufficiently responsive.

        2 - Rigid camera does not rotate except by user command.

    fps 0

        This key enables an on-screen frames-per-second counter. Press
        F9 to toggle this flag in-game.

    nice 1

        This  key  enables  a  delay  function  after  each  frame  is
        rendered, forcing a context  switch and ensuring that the game
        does not utilize 100% of the CPU.  0 is off, 1 is on.

        If the  frame rate is not  fast enough for you,  or you simply
        want to  test the  performance of the  game on  your hardware,
        disable it.

        Press F8 to toggle this flag in-game.

    high_level 1

        This key gives the number  of the highest level you've opened.
        You  can cheat by  setting this  to a  big number.   It's open
        source,  so there's  absolutely no  way to  keep  players from
        cheating.  Might as well just document it.

    joy 0

        This key  enables joystick control.  0  is off, 1  is on.  The
        game may still be controlled with the mouse even while gamepad
        control  is enabled.   However,  random noise  from an  analog
        controller at rest can disrupt normal mouse input.

    axis_x 0

        Joystick horizontal axis number

    axis_y 1

        Joystick vertical axis number

    button_a 0

        Joystick menu select button

    button_b 1

        Joystick menu cancel button

    button_r 2

        Joystick counter-clockwise camera rotation button

    button_l 3

        Joystick clockwise camera rotation button

    button_exit 4

        Joystick exit button
