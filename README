Super Empty Ball is an  simulation of the physics of spheres interacting
with faceted solid geometry.  It requires:

    libjpeg
    libpng

To build, choose one of the following target options and run make:

    make linux                      # Linux, no sound
    make alsa                       # Linux, ALSA sound
    make irix                       # 32-bit IRIX

The default  target is linux.  The  alsa target requires  ALSA 0.9.  The
irix target assumes that libpng is installed in the /usr/freeware/ tree.

The executables will be copied into bin/. Environments will be processed
and copied into data/sol/.  The program must be run from within the base
seb directory in order for materials and textures to resolve correctly.

To run:

    bin/ball

Click to begin.  The world tilts  in the direction of the mouse pointer.
Escape  pauses.  Control-Q  while paused  returns to  the  title screen.
Escape at the title screen exits.

The physics system starts to destablize at about 50Hz, so if your system
cannot  maintain  50 FPS  then  simulation  time  will run  slower  than
realtime.  If  your video card  is lacking in  power you can  shrink the
window  or  remove  the  definition  of  REFLECT  at  the  beginning  of
ball/game.c.  If  your processor is  lacking in power, there's  not much
you can do.

Any resemblance to any other software,  game,  or simulation related  to
super  forms of balls possibly non-empty potentially containing  monkeys
is purely coincidental.
